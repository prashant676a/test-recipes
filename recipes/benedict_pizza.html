    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These whole-grain pancakes are the best I've ever made. I have a container of the dry mix in my fridge at all times, ready for me whenever I get a hankering for some breakfast food. The oats give the pancakes a bit of texture, which makes them a joy to eat – I like when my food has more than one note to it.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups dry milk powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Cook until pancakes are golden brown on both sides; serve hot.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, sift all-purpose flour, milk powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir in whole wheat flour. In a small bowl, combine sugar, eggs, water, butter and vinegar. Make a well in the flour mixture, and pour in the egg mixture. Mix until smooth.</li>
    </ol>
